# Discover your Spotify Top Songs
Discover your Most Played Songs, Artists, and Genres!


# Description
This web application uses the Spotify API to get a User's Top Songs data from different time ranges, depending on the User's preference.
It uses Python-Flask as the backend, and HTML CSS and JavaScript for the front-end.


## Future of the Project
The project is still in development, but some of the features envisioned are:

- Create a Spotify playlist with your top songs
- Implementing an algorithm to analyze User's most listened genres (and display it in a cool way!)
- Add Recommendations based of user's Top Songs, or based of User's most played songs in the past few weeks
